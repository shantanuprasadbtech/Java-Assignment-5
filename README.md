Abstract Shape Class calculation 

Shape Class
The abstract class that serves as the base class with the following methods:

stateShape()
This method prints the shape chosen.

calculateArea()
This method is abstract and does not have an implementation in the Shape class. It is implemented in the derived classes to calculate the area of the specific shape.

calculatePerimeter()
This method is abstract and does not have an implementation in the Shape class. It is implemented in the derived classes to calculate the perimeter of the specific shape.

Square Class
This class is derived from the Shape class and represents a square shape. It has the following methods:

Square()
This is the constructor method for the Square class. It prompts the user to input the length of the square's sides.

calculateArea()
This method overrides the calculateArea() method of the Shape class to calculate the area of a square.

calculatePerimeter()
This method overrides the calculatePerimeter() method of the Shape class to calculate the perimeter of a square.

Rectangle Class
This class is derived from the Shape class and represents a rectangle shape. It has the following methods:

Rectangle()
This is the constructor method for the Rectangle class. It prompts the user to input the length and width of the rectangle.

calculateArea()
This method overrides the calculateArea() method of the Shape class to calculate the area of a rectangle.

calculatePerimeter()
This method overrides the calculatePerimeter() method of the Shape class to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle.

Circle Class
This class is derived from the Shape class and represents a circle shape. It has the following methods:

Circle()
This is the constructor method for the Circle class. It prompts the user to input the radius of the circle.

calculateArea()
This method overrides the calculateArea() method of the Shape class to calculate the area of a circle.

calculatePerimeter()
This method overrides the calculatePerimeter() method of the Shape class to calculate the circumference of a circle.

Pyramid Class
This class is derived from the Shape class and implements the Volume interface. It represents a pyramid shape. It has the following methods:

Pyramid()
This is the constructor method for the Pyramid class. It prompts the user to input the length, width, and height of the pyramid.

calculateArea()
This method overrides the calculateArea() method of the Shape class to calculate the surface area of a pyramid.

calculatePerimeter()
This method overrides the calculatePerimeter() method of the Shape class to calculate the perimeter of a pyramid.

calculateVolume()
This method implements the calculateVolume() method of the Volume interface to calculate the volume of a pyramid.

Cylinder Class
